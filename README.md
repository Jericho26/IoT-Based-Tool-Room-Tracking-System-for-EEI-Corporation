# IoT-Based-Tool-Room-Tracking-System-for-EEI-Corporation
A prototype mobile tracking system presented in this project was created to enhance the management of tools in the tool room at EEI Corporation.
The solution provides real-time monitoring and efficient tool tracking by combining RFID technology, sensors, and a centralized digital system. In    manual inventory systems, common problems include tool misplacement, delays, and a lack of accountability.
To address this, the team created an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system that automatically logs tool issuance and returns, instantly updates inventory status, and facilitates better tool usage tracking for Admin and users.
The prototype makes it simple for authorized personnel to keep an eye on tool availability and movement by fusing hardware elements (like RFID scanners and microcontrollers) with a web-based interface.


# üì± Project Overview

Moshi is a mobile-based prototype aimed at enhancing motorcycle rider safety by integrating core emergency response features into a companion app. The system supports:

* GPS-based location tracking
  
* SOS emergency alerts sent through the app
  
* Device status monitoring synced from the helmet hardware
  
This capstone project represents the initial development phase, focusing on mobile functionality and simulated data from IoT hardware. The system is designed to assist both riders and emergency contacts during critical events by improving communication and response times.

# üîß Development Model

We followed the IoT System Development Lifecycle to guide the creation of the Tool Room Tracking System for EEI Corporation. This framework ensured a structured process, from planning the system architecture to testing both hardware and software components.
The tool room at EEI Corporation lacked adequate tracking and real-time visibility. 
The objective was to create a system that would decrease tool losses, increase accountability, and automate the tracking of tool issuance and returns. We planned the integration of IoT components with a centralized database, specified user roles, and delineated system requirements.
Planning
Design
We designed system wireframes for the web-based dashboard and sketched hardware placement (RFID scanners, sensors). The interface was made simple for both tool room staff and supervisors. Clear user flows were established for borrowing, returning, and monitoring tools in real time.
Development
The system was built using RFID technology, an NodeMCU microcontroller, and a cloud-based platform for data synchronizing were used in the development of the system. A real-time database that records every tool transaction was linked to the backend. In order to manage users, view tool status, and create inventory reports, a web-based admin panel was created concurrently. To guarantee smooth data updates, hardware and software components were synchronized.
Testing
Initial testing was done to confirm inventory logging, data synchronization, and RFID scanning accuracy. We verified database accuracy, tracked dashboard updates, and used test tags to simulate borrowing and returning tools. During this phase, problems like lagging updates and duplicate scans were found and fixed to improve reliability.
