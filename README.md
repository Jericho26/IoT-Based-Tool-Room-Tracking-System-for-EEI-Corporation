# IoT-Based-Tool-Room-Tracking-System-for-EEI-Corporation


# üì± Project Overview

We followed the IoT System Development Lifecycle to guide the creation of the Tool Room Tracking System for EEI Corporation. This framework ensured a structured process, from planning the system architecture to testing both hardware and software components.
The tool room at EEI Corporation lacked adequate tracking and real-time visibility. 
The objective was to create a system that would decrease tool losses, increase accountability, and automate the tracking of tool issuance and returns. We planned the integration of IoT components with a centralized database, specified user roles, and delineated system requirements.
Planning
Design
We designed system wireframes for the web-based dashboard and sketched hardware placement (RFID scanners, sensors). The interface was made simple for both tool room staff and supervisors. Clear user flows were established for borrowing, returning, and monitoring tools in real time.
Development
The system was built using RFID technology, an NodeMCU microcontroller, and a cloud-based platform for data synchronizing were used in the development of the system. A real-time database that records every tool transaction was linked to the backend. In order to manage users, view tool status, and create inventory reports, a web-based admin panel was created concurrently. To guarantee smooth data updates, hardware and software components were synchronized.
Testing
Initial testing was done to confirm inventory logging, data synchronization, and RFID scanning accuracy. We verified database accuracy, tracked dashboard updates, and used test tags to simulate borrowing and returning tools. During this phase, problems like lagging updates and duplicate scans were found and fixed to improve reliability.
